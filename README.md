For this design I chose to use my previous assignment's faces as I was happy with how the aesthetic of these turned out. I had a lot of issues moving this code into the new framework, partly because object oriented coding wasn't something I had touched in a long time and also because some of my assignment 2 code was poorly constructed. My use of maps made the transferring particularly difficult. My first attempt at moving the code over was unsuccessfull as I over commited to the tracking of the facial features causing them to overlap. To fix this I ended up using a lot of push/pop, translate and scale. I chose the 'mask' approach to this assignment rather than heavy tracking/ features drawn straight onto the face, because I wanted to preserve the aesthetic i had found in my last assignment. i felt that the best way to do this was to draw the whole face - head+hair included over the subject. 

It took a long time for me to wrap my head around the scope of this project and I found it challenging to envision what the end result with me. However, as we were given more information in class, I started to get an idea of how the AI worked and began looking at ways my faces could reflect different features. My previous project focused on making as many different types of faces as I could and I thought i could use this to my advantage by assigning each of these features to a logical trait. 

masc/fem faces - tracked to masc/fem faces
3 eye types - tracked to differing eye sizes
4 nose types - tracked to differing nose sizes
2 lip types - tracked to smiling/non smiling
moustache - tracked to facial hair
5 hair styles - tracked to particular hairstyles
If the hair is long - track length of hair 

I wanted to get the faces to a point where they were varied but still held the core aesthetic of my last project. This meant paying a lot of attention to the spacing of the features in comparison to the head size. I did a lot of editing to get this to a point I was reasonably happy with. 

As the project progressed I realised I need some more obvious traits reflected in the training e.g. hair colour and age. - I incorporated these through colour and added eye wrinkles. The colour range changes based on whether the face is masculine/feminine, while the eye wrinkles get darker the older the face is. This definitely helped with the identification/training quiz aspect of the project. 

I trained the AI multiple times to try and get the results I wanted, but I really struggled to get it accurate. I wasn't/am not sure if this is part of the AI's capabilities or what I addressed in my code. In retrospect I think I should have focused on 'larger' more obvious changing variables between faces rather than eye size/nose size. These are sometimes such tiny changes that it can be difficult to train the AI accurately. I also unfortunately ended up spending too much time transferring my original code into the new framework, which cut into the time I would have liked to use to train the AI/

Overall, I really struggled with this project. Even though I'm happy with the aesthetic outcome of the faces, the accuracy of the AI training was a lot more difficult than expected, and didn't turn out the way I wanted. Unfortunately I ran out of time to continue training the AI to a better accuracy, but I would have definitely continued to do this to get my faces to a point where I was happy.
